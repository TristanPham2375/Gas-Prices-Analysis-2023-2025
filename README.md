# Gas-Prices-Analysis-2023-2025
This project examines the correlation between gas prices in Toronto and the overall average price in Canada, as well as the volatility in different regions and the comparison between gas prices in Toronto and other major cities in Ontario (Ottawa and Thunder Bay).

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### Data Sources:
- The data includes historical gas prices across Canada, with specific focus on **Toronto**, **Ontario**, and other regions in Canada.
- The dataset spans several years to capture price trends, volatility, and regional differences.

### Analysis Focus:
1. **Correlation of Toronto's Gas Prices with the National Average**: Assessing whether Toronto's gas prices follow national trends or have unique fluctuations.
2. **Volatility of Gas Prices Across Regions**: Identifying which regions experience the highest and lowest volatility in gas prices.
3. **Comparison of Toronto's Gas Prices with Other Ontario Cities**: Comparing gas price trends in Toronto with the average prices in **Ottawa** and **Thunder Bay**.

### Deliverables:
- Visualizations showing how Torontoâ€™s gas prices compare with national and regional averages.
- Insights into regional volatility and price stability.
- Understanding whether gas price trends in Toronto are unique or follow broader trends in Ontario and Canada.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **matplotlib**: For general plotting and customizing visualizations.

## ðŸ“‚ Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
Before running the code, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

### Prerequisites:
Before running the code, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

1. **Install Python**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Install the required libraries**: Run the following command to install all necessary libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
3. **Install Data File**: Ensure that the dataset file Data_File.csv is placed in the correct directory. Update the file path in the code accordingly:
python
   ```bash
   data_temp = pd.read_csv(r"C:\path\to\your\data\Data_File.csv")
4. **Editing**: I recommned jupyter notebook to acess and edit the contents. You can download jupyter notebook:
